# TerraWeek Challenge

#TerraWeek Challenge is a 7 Day challenge to upskill in DevOps.

This repository documents my journey to deepen my understanding of Terraform, its core principles, and its applications for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Over this week, I'll be tackling daily tasks, projects, or challenges, sharing insights, and improving my Terraform skills.
